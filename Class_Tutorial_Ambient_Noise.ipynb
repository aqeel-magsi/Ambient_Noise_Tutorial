    "### What is ambient noise\n",
    "\n",
    "In seismology, the term \"noise\" refers to ground motion which is recorded in the absence of an identifiable source of seismic energy, such as an earthquake. In particular, seismic noise is the weak, low-frequency seismic signal originating from randomly distributed sources. The continuous interaction of low frequency (<1Hz) oceanic surface waves (swells) with the Earth's crust is the main cause of natural ambient noise  and is observed globally (Aki and Richards). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often discarded and cannot be used for geophysical applications, but not always. Seismic noise can be utilized for earth imaging in the border sense, i.e., structural analysis of crust, global tomography, and monitoring velocity changes along faults and volcanic regions. For instance, the cross-correlation of seismic noise reflects the medium properties along the prorogation path.\n",
    "\n",
    "this process is known as Seismic noise interferometry (SNI)."

    "Given two seismometers, u_1 and u_2, placed at some distance apart on the surface, the stations will record ground motion as a function of time: u_1(t) and u_2(t). Over long periods of time, the cross-correlation of ground motions of u_1(t) and u_2(t)\n",

    "A useful way to understand the role of cross-correlation in SNI is that it highlights the traveltimes of seismic waves. A wavefield which has travelled between two stations will cause a similar signal to be recorded at each, shifted in time: the cross-correlation function (CCF) of the records will therefore contain a peak at a time lag which corresponds to the traveltime of the wavefield between the two stations (Fig.2)."

Oceanic noise arrives from all directions, and the noise records which are cross-correlated during SNI therefore contain energy which has travelled in both directions along an interstation path.\n",
    "\n",
    "GFs which emerge on noise cross-correlation functions (NCFs) will therefore contain energy in both the causal and acausal parts, symmetric about zero time lag: the causal part representing energy arriving at station B in response to an impulsive source at station A, and the acausal part energy arriving at station A in response to a source at station B (Fig.3). Because GFs are usually assumed to be the same in both directions along a path, the two sides of an NCF can be treated as representing exactly the same information, but reversed in time."
